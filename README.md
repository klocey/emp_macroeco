emp_macroeco
=====
A repository of code and data to investigate macroecological patterns of diversity-abundance relationships, species-abundance distribution, and patterns of nestedness in the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) dataset.

Exploring interactions between microbial activity, encounter dynamics, and dimensions of resource, trophic, and metabolic complexity by pushing the limits of modern ecological modeling with information intensive individual-based modeling.

### Contents
This repository contains preliminary open-source code, simulated data, and figures.
